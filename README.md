# Cr::Exec

> Wrapper for ruby exec

The improved exec lib inspired from Crystal

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add cr-exec

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install cr-exec

## Usage

```ruby
# Mind Please !!!
require "cr/exec"

class MyClass
    extend Cr::Exec
    include Cr::Exec
end

MyClass.run("uname")

m = MyClass.new
m.run("uname")
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
